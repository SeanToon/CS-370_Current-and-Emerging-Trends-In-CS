For this project, I was provided with code that set up a correct environment for an intelligent agent to navigate through a maze. The code given created a maze object defined as a matrix and proper storage for episodes or the different possible states that could exist between the initial and terminal state. The code that I created myself is deep Q-Learning Training Algorithm. The code teaches an agent to find the best possible navigation sequence in reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward.

Other than the technical skills that I have gathered from this course I have also been able to evaulate different important topics about the field of computer science. I was able to get a better understanding of what a computer scientist that focuses on the development of AI does, and how the work is important to the field and ultimately to the grown of human knowledge. I think that AI and machine learning is an important field to study because not only does it continue to provide humans with useful tool for daily life but it gives us a deeper understanding into human consciousness. 

It is an important role to contribute to the growth of technologies within computer science. It takes alot of skill and determination to keep your head above water and keep pace with the ever growing field. As a computer scientist, I spend about 90 percent of my time feeling like I dont know what I am doing when working on a project, but 10 percent of the time concepts come easy to me and I am assured that the work I have put in is showing some reward. Nevertheless, I continue to push on and hold a strong passion for problem solving and learning about computer science strengthens my problem-solving skills each day. Out of all my problem-solving skills, I think the most important ones to start with when working on any project is patience and organization. Keeping a positive mindset, having patience and being willing to step away  from a project to think critically and clearly is an important for production and success with a project. Organization and planning is also important so that problem solving becomes an iterative process that is constructive and precise rather than a process that is random and uncertain. 

Lastly, a computer scientist should always recognize and follow the ethical responsibilities that encompass any project. With any project, ensuring the security and privacy of users and organizations is top priority. It is also unethical to develop any kind of technology with the intentions to harm yourself or others in any way.
