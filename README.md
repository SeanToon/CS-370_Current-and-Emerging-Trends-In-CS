For this project, I was provided with an environment designed for an intelligent agent to navigate through a maze. The code I received created a maze object defined as a matrix, along with storage to track episodes—representing the various states the agent might encounter as it moves from the initial to the terminal state. The code I developed, however, is the Deep Q-Learning Training Algorithm, which teaches the agent to identify the best navigation sequence for reaching the treasure cell while maximizing the reward. This algorithm is fundamental in guiding the agent toward optimal decisions in an environment with complex states.

Beyond the technical skills I’ve developed through this course, I’ve also gained valuable insights into several important topics within the field of computer science. Through this project, I gained a clearer understanding of the role of a computer scientist specializing in artificial intelligence (AI) development. I now see how this work is vital not only to advancing technology but also to the broader understanding of human knowledge. AI and machine learning are critical fields to study, as they not only provide humans with powerful tools for improving daily life but also offer deeper insights into human cognition and consciousness.

Contributing to the growth of technologies in computer science is a significant responsibility. The fast pace of innovation in the field can sometimes feel overwhelming. As a computer scientist, I often find that about 90% of the time, I’m unsure of my approach when working on a project. However, during the remaining 10% of the time, when I solve a problem or make progress, it validates the effort I’ve put in and reaffirms my passion for the work. Regardless of the challenges, I am driven by my love for problem-solving and my commitment to continuously learning.

Through this journey, I’ve realized that two of the most essential skills for any project are patience and organization. Patience allows me to approach challenges methodically and not rush through solutions. It’s also important to step back when necessary and think critically and clearly. Organization is equally crucial, as it ensures that problem-solving becomes an iterative and structured process, not a haphazard or uncertain one. With the right planning, problem-solving becomes both constructive and efficient.

Lastly, as a computer scientist, it’s essential to recognize and adhere to the ethical responsibilities that come with any project. Ensuring the security and privacy of users and organizations should always be a top priority. It is also important to develop technology with the intention of enhancing well-being, rather than causing harm to oneself or others. Ethical considerations must guide every decision made in the development of technology, ensuring that it serves humanity in a responsible and beneficial manner.
